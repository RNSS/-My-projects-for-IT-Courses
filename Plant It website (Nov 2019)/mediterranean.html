          <h3><strong>What is Mediterranean Climate?</strong></h3>

<p>Mediterranean climate is very pleasant climate with warm, dry summers and cool, mild winters. It gets it's name from the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the coastal land around the Mediterranean Sea experience this climate. This climate's most important cause is the large bodies of water near the land and Mediterranean is only found along sthe coast.</p>
<p id="where-is-mediterranean-climate-usually-located">
<h3><strong>Where is Mediterranean Climate Usually Located?</strong></h3>

<p>Mediterranean climate is found between the 30 degrees and 45 degree latitudes. This climate is often found on the western sides of continents. Mediterranean climate gets its name from the climate found around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p id="what-seasons-does-mediterranean-climate-have">
<h3><strong>What Seasons Does Mediterranean Climate Have?</strong></h3>
<p>Mediterranean climate is very mild (few extreme temperatures), so it really only has 2 seasons: summer and winter.Summers are longer than winter, and the winter is very mild.Very few places experience snow in a Mediterranean climate.The seasonal changes are due to changes in ocean currents and water temperature.</p>
<p id="what-are-the-Temperatures-like-in-mediterranean-climate">
<h3><strong>What are the Temperatures like in Mediterranean Climate?</strong></h3>
<p>The climate is known for warm or hot, dry summers and mild or cool, wet winters. Winter temperatures are usually between 30 and 65 degrees. Summer months all average above 50 degrees. The warmest month averages about 72 degrees.The cause of this climate is directly related to large bodies of water such as the Mediterranean Sea and ocean currents for other areas. During the summer, cold currents keep the climate mild and dry. Ocean currents shift as the seasons change. During the winter the water that was warmed up all summer moves in and keeps the land warm and often brings rain.</p>
<p id="how-much-Precipitation-Does-mediterranean-climate-receive">
<h3><strong>How Much Precipitation Does Mediterranean Climate Receive?</strong></h3>
<p>Mediterranean climate is a mostly dry climate. Almost no rain falls during the summer, so most of the rain falls during the cooler winter. The summer experiences cold ocean currents that bring dry air and no precipitation. During the winter, the currents shift and warmer, moist air brings rain to these areas. Snow can fall in higher elevation areas or places that are farther north. Mediterranean climates receive around 20 inches of annual (yearly) rainfall.</p>
