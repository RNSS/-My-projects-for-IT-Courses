It might be hard to plant in temperate climate due to the climate challenges that make it hard for plants to survive
however, with some tips and advices and maybe a little bit of knowledge you will manage to plant your favorite plants and enjoy watching them grow.
<br><br>
First, you need to know the nature of the climate area that you live in to find out the best plants to grow/plant.

                <h3 id="Temperate-climates-Introduction">Temperate climates - Introduction:</h3>
<p> those without extremes of temperature and precipitation (rain and snow). The changes between summer and winter are generally invigorating without being frustratingly extreme. There are two types of temperate climate: maritime and continental.
    <br><br>
The maritime climate is strongly influenced by the oceans, which maintain fairly steady temperatures across the seasons.
    <br><br>
Continental climate increases inland, with warmer summers and colder winters as the effect of land on heat receipt and loss increases
</p>
                <h3 id="Environmental-factor">Environmental factors</h3>
<div>
                <ul>
     <li>Air temperature</li>
      <li>Humidity</li>
     <li>Air movement </li>
    <li>Heat radiated from the sun and surroundings.</li>

        <ol>
    <h4 id="The-temperate-deciduous-forest"><li>The temperate deciduous forest:</li></h4>
    <p>There are four distinct seasons in the temperate deciduous forest: spring, summer, autumn, and winter.  The temperature varies from hot in the summer to below freezing in the winter.  Rain is plentiful, about 30 to 50 inches per year.  The temperate deciduous forest is made up of layers of plants; the number of layers depends upon factors such as climate, soil, and the age of the forest.  The tallest trees make up the forest canopy which can be 100 feet or more above the ground.  Beneath the canopy, the understory contains smaller trees and young trees.  These understory trees are more shade tolerant than canopy trees.  Below the understory is a shrub layer.  Carpeting the forest floor is the herb layer made up of wildflowers, mosses, and ferns.  Fallen leaves, twigs, and dried plants cover the ground, decompose, and help add nutrients to the topsoil.</p>

            <h4>Temperate Deciduous Forest Plant Adaptations</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>wildflowers grow on forest floor early in the spring before trees leaf-out and shade the forest floor</li>
                <li>many trees are deciduous (they drop their leaves in the autumn, and grow new ones in spring).  Most deciduous trees have thin, broad, light-weight leaves that can capture a lot of sunlight to make a lot of food for the tree in warm weather; when the weather gets cooler, the broad leaves cause too much water loss and can be weighed down by too much snow, so the tree drops its leaves.  New ones will grow in the spring.</li>
                <li>trees have thick bark to protect against cold winters</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="he-Temperate-Rain-Forest"><li>The Temperate Rain Forest</li></h4>
            <p>The temperate rain forest features minimal seasonal fluctuation of temperature: the winters are mild and the summers cool.  The temperate rain forest receives a lot of precipitation, about 80 to 152 inches per year.  Condensation from coastal fogs also add to the dampness.  The soil is poor in nutrients.  Large evergreen trees, some reaching 300 feet in height, are the dominant plant species.</p>
            <h4>Temperate Rain Forest Plant Adaptations</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>epiphytes such as mosses and ferns grow atop other plants to reach light.</li>
                <li>cool temperatures lead to slow decomposition but seedlings grow on "nurse logs" to take advantage of the nutrients from the decomposing fallen logs.</li>
                <li>trees can grow very tall due to amount of precipitation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="The-Temperate-Grasslands"><li>The Temperate Grasslands</li></h4>
            <p>The temperate grasslands, also called prairie, feature hot summers and cold winters.  Rainfall is uncertain and drought is common.  The temperate grasslands usually receive about 10 to 30 inches of precipitation per year.  The soil is extremely rich in organic material due to the fact that the above-ground portions of grasses die off annually, enriching the soil.  The area is well-suited to agriculture, and few original prairies survive today.</p>

            <h4>Temperate Grassland (Prairie) Plant Adaptations</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>During a fire, while above-ground portions of grasses may perish, the root portions survive to sprout again</li>
                <li>Some prairie trees have thick bark to resist fire</li>
                <li>Prairie shrubs readily resprout after fire</li>
                <li>Roots of prairie grasses extend deep into the ground to absorb as much moisture as they can</li>
                <li>Extensive root systems prevent grazing animals from pulling roots out of the ground</li>
                <li>Prairie grasses have narrow leaves which lose less water than broad leaves</li>
                <li>Grasses grow from near their base, not from tip, thus are not permanently damaged from grazing animals or fire</li>
                <li>Many grasses take advantage of exposed, windy conditions and are wind pollinated</li>
                <li>Soft stems enable prairie grasses to bend in the wind</li>
            </ul>
                    </ol>

    <img src="img/The-beech.png" alt="The beech" width="234.4" height ="312.8" >
        <p>Beeches (Fagus selvatica) can reach up to 40 mt tall and have a large, dome-shaped foliage. Their fruits, called beech nuts, look like chestnut husks, but their thorns do not prick since they are softer and more rounded. They prefer clayey and airy soils, in wet areas, away from harsh winter frost. They are common in Central and Western Europe, where they are largely used to make timber. They are not only extremely useful (furniture, parks, railway sleepers, cellulose), but also commonly used as ornamental trees.</p>
                        <h4><li>Sycamore</li></h4>
         <img src="img/Sycamore.png" alt="Sycamore" width="300" height ="300">
        <p>Sycamores (Acer pseudoplatanus) live essentially in hilly and mountainous northern woods only, up to 1800 m above sea level. They grow quickly, they like fresh and wet soils and can reach up to 25-30 mt tall.</p>
                        <h4><li>Oak</li></h4>
        <img src="img/Oak.png" alt="Oak" width="379.8" height="306.9">
        <p>Oaks (Quercus spp.) are trees or shrubs that can reach up to 40 mt tall. Oaks can live to 500 – 1000 years of age. Their fruits are elongated acorns, protected at the base by a cup-shaped shell. They are widespread in tropical mountain areas (Mexico, Himalaya, Indonesia), in Mediterranean climates (California, Mediterranean areas) and in temperate climates (North America, Asia, Europe). Oaks are used to make timber, stairs, parks, furniture, casks and railway sleepers.</p>
                        <h4><li>Aspen</li></h4>
        <img src="img/Aspen.png" alt="Aspen" width="240" height="300">
        <p>Aspens (Populus tremula) are medium-size trees than can reach up to 25 mt tall. They grow quickly. They like warm and sunny areas. They are scattered about Central Europe and rarer in Western Europe. They can be grown on uncultivated land to graft them quickly and for long. They are very resistant to industrial waste, and actually grow well in town.</p>
                        <h4><li>Walnut tree </li></h4>
        <img src="img/Walnut-tree.png" alt="Walnut tree">
        <p>Walnut trees (Juglas regia) are large trees that can reach up to 20 mt tall. Their fruits are stone fruits (they are fleshy fruits, i.e. the ovary wall that envelops the seeds becomes juicy when mature) with a green fleshy part (husk), which, when dry, releases its woody stone (walnut) which contains an edible seed rich in fats. Walnut trees are widespread everywhere as fruit trees and for their precious timber which is used to make furniture; they are productively grown in temperate areas: the most important walnut producing country are the United States.</p>
                        <h4><li>Lime tree </li></h4>
     <img src="img/Lime-tree.png" alt="Lime tre" width="473.2" height="315.9">
        <p>Lime trees (Tilia cordata) are beautiful, straight-trunk trees that can reach up to 30 metres tall. There are a variety of lime trees, one of the most common ones being the Tilia platyphyilos. Wild lime trees can be found in coppices, bushes, sunny slopes and rocks, along riverbanks in the mountain and submontane areas of Central Europe; it is rarer in Western Europe. Lime trees are often used to shade town streets, to decorate parks and gardens. For its look and scent, the ancient Greeks have always associated this plant to womanliness; they actually considered it as Aphrodite’s favourite tree.</p>
                        <h4><li>Chestnut tree</li></h4>
          <img src="img/Chestnut-tree.png" alt="hestnut tree" >
        <p>Chestnut trees (Castanea sativa) are big, 20-30 m tall trees. Their flowers are encased in a thorny “husk”, which is first green, then turns brown-yellowish. Once fecundated, it produces the fruits, i.e. the chestnuts. More specifically, these fruits can be called chestnuts if each husk contains two or three fruits. If a husk produces only one fruit, then such fruit, which is very big and spheroid, is called ‘marron’. Chestnuts ripen in autumn. Depending on the variety, some of which ripen earlier, some later, they can be eaten fresh from early September to early November.</p>
                        <h4><li>Birch</li></h4>
                        <img src="img/Birch.png" alt="Birch">
        <p>Birches (Betula pendula) come from Europe and the south-east of Asia. They grow well in sandy and peaty soils. The genus takes its name from the Celtic betu. Silver birches are widespread in Europe, where they reach a latitude of 65° north and Sicily south. They love the sun, they grow alone or in small groups in hilly and mountainous sparse woods, along with broad-leaved and coniferous trees. In the wild state, they can grow even on dry and bare, preferably acid, soils, with enough water, and can tolerate the cold quite well. They are used as ornamental trees for their elegant deportment and the decorative colour of their bark and leaves., associandosi a latifoglie e conifere.</p>
                        <h4><li>Elm</li></h4>
                <img src="img/Elm.png" alt="Elm" width="446" height="299.49" >
        <p>Elms (Ulmus carpinifolia) come from North-Africa, Europe and south-western Asia. They are Ulmaceae plants and can reach up to 30 m tall. Their foliage is hemispherical, their branches are thin and pale brown, their flowers are small and red. Their bark is grey-brown with deep furrows, their leaves are oval with a pointed end and a slanting base.</p>
                        <h4><li>Tulip tree</li></h4>
        <img src="img/Tulip-tree.png" alt="Tulip tree" width="226" height="299">
        <p>Tulip trees (Liriodendron tulipifera) take their name from the fact their flowers are shaped like tulips. This species comes from the eastern part of North America and has been brought to our continent in the mid-17th century, when it was used as an ornamental tree for the beauty of its flowers and leaves and in Central Europe also to make timber. A heliophilus (that loves light), rural and long-living plant, it tolerates harsh cold quite well, but is very demanding when it comes to soil, that must be deep and fertile. The wood of the tulip-tree is pale yellow and is called “yellow poplar” because it looks like it; it is fairly good quality, woodworm-proof and can be used in a wide range of applications</p>

                    <ul>
        <li>Keep your fruit trees well watered and mulched as they ripen fruit like plums, apples, pears and quinces. Collect and compost any fallen fruit</li>
        <li>Don’t be afraid to snip a few leaves off the zucchini’s or sunflowers or pumpkins if they are bullying and shading their neighbours. They’ll keep producing new leaves to replace what you remove, and the new growth will be more resistant to mildew.</li>
        <li>Keep tying up your tomatoes, if you’re that way inclined, and break off any lower leaves that are all yellowed and curled up. Once fruit is developing and starting to ripen, try to keep the watering even to prevent blossom end rot.</li>
                    </ul>

 <h3 id="Featured-Permaculture-Principle">Featured Permaculture Principle: Catch and Store Energy</h3>
 <p>(Read more about this principle
<a class="link-color"href="https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_2/">here</a>)</p>
    <ul>
 <li>Seeing as preserving is such a big focus in February, you can really make the most of the energy used to heat water in vacola systems. Once your bottled fruit is finished, you can CAREFULLY empty the still very hot water into a watering can (in a few batches is a good idea) and then pour this hot water onto weeds in pathway cracks. It will ‘cook’ the weeds and kill these plants that can otherwise be tricky to deal with. WEAR SOLID SHOES when you’re on the hot water weed killing rampage, or you might end up cooking your toes too.</li>
        <br><br>
 <li>Plant leaves are essentially solar panels, catching the energy of the sun and using it to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into plant tissue, with some help from minerals and nutrients in the soil. So any spare corner of your garden or patio that catches the sun can be an energy collector. If you grow a plant like comfrey, or borage, or yarrow in that spot, then regularly harvest and put the leaves from that plant in the compost, or feed it to your chooks, you’ll be building the fertility of your garden, building the carbon reserves in your soil, and ‘charging’ the great life-giving energy bank of the soil that we need to keep us healthy.</li>
